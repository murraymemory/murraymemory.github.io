My academic career so far has been spent at the University of York. I gained a degree in mathematics but was more interested in how I was learning it than actually learning it. Then I decided to become a maths teacher, but I was more interested in how people learn than actually teaching them. So, I finally switched to psychology and now spend my days trying to understand how people learn and remember.

I'm currently a PhD Student at the [Univeristy of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/postgrads/murray,-ewan/) and a member of the [numerical cognition](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/research/development-and-cultural-processes/numerical-cognition-lab/) and [episodic memory](http://www.aidanhorner.org/) labs. My main interests are optimising learning and memory, developing expertise, metascience and philosophy of science.
