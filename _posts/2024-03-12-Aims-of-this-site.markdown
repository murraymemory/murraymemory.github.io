I found myself incredibly inspired by the personal sites of [Gwern], 
[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/).

I frequently do deep dives into things but, don't end up taking good [evergreen notes] that I return to and build upon.

This will not be an icredibly polished site. It is for my own use and is made available to the public only so that I am forced to write in such a way that my notes are readable, concise and will be understandable to my future self.

My plan is first to begin by relaying my current ideas around key areas of interest to me, I hope that these will form the backbone of my notes:
- Cognitive Psychology
  - Learning
    - What to learn?
    - How to learn?
    - When to learn?
  - Memory
    - What is it to remember on different levels?
  - Techniques for improving learning and memory
    - Distributed practice
    - Retrieval practice
    - Pretesting
  - Computational modelling
    - Models of memory
- Philosophy
  - Philosophy of science
    - Models
    - Theory development
